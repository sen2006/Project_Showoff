// This is a very interesting class i know.
// Even tough it looks useless, it does do something.
// It is nice, it allows [SerializeField, ReadOnly] to exist.
// I like this class.
// i think i will call it Bob.
// Yes, Bob the ReadOnlyAttribute.
// I hope you like Bob too.
// Enjoy all Bob has to bring.
